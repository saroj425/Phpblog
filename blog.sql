I&#39;ve tried best practices in design and development process as they have emerged from the leaders in the object-oriented development community. Some of my projects were very successful; a few failed. A feature common to the successes was a rich domain model that evolved through iterations of design and became part of the fabric of the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book provides a framework for making design decisions and a technical vocabulary for discussing domain design. It is a synthesis of widely accepted best practices along with my own insights and experiences.

The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called &ldquo;Divide-and-Conquer&rdquo;), and an appendix on matrices.

Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, non-optimal applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as refactoring, these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process.

That&#39;s what is Lorem Ipsum to many&mdash;it rubs them the wrong way, all the way. It&#39;s unreal, uncanny, makes you wonder if something is wrong, it seems to seek your attention for all the wrong reasons. Usually, we prefer the real thing, wine without sulfur based preservatives, real butter, not margarine, and so we&#39;d like our layouts and designs to be filled with real words, with thoughts that count, information that has value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The toppings you may chose for that TV dinner pizza slice when you forgot to shop for foods, the paint you may slap on your face to impress the new boss is your business. But what about your daily bread? Design comps, layouts, wireframes&mdash;will your clients accept that you go about things the facile way? Authorities in our business will tell in no uncertain terms that Lorem Ipsum is that huge, huge no no to forswear forever. Not so fast, I&#39;d say, there are some redeeming factors in favor of greeking text, as its use is merely the symptom of a worse problem to take into consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost/blog/webmag/img/post-4.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So Lorem Ipsum is bad (not necessarily)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You begin with a text, you sculpt information, you chisel away what&#39;s not needed, you come to the point, make things clear, add value, you&#39;re a content person, you like words. Design is no afterthought, far from it, but it comes in a deserved second. Anyway, you still use Lorem Ipsum and rightly so, as it will always have a place in the web workers toolbox, as things happen, not always the way you like it, not always in the preferred order. Even if your less into design and more into content strategy you may find some redeeming value with, wait for it, dummy copy, no less.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s lot of hate out there for a text that amounts to little more than garbled words in an old language. The villagers are out there with a vengeance to get that Frankenstein, wielding torches and pitchforks, wanting to tar and feather it at the least, running it out of town in shame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the villagers, Kristina Halvorson from Adaptive Path, holds steadfastly to the notion that design can&rsquo;t be tested without real content:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I&rsquo;ve heard the argument that &ldquo;lorem ipsum&rdquo; is effective in wireframing or design because it helps people focus on the actual layout, or color scheme, or whatever. What kills me here is that we&rsquo;re talking about creating a user experience that will (whether we like it or not) be DRIVEN by words. The entire structure of the page or app flow is FOR THE WORDS.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>If that&#39;s what you think how bout the other way around? How can you evaluate content without design? No typography, no colors, no layout, no styles, all those things that convey the important signals that go beyond the mere textual, hierarchies of information, weight, emphasis, oblique stresses, priorities, all those subtle cues that also have visual and emotional appeal to the reader. Rigid proponents of content strategy may shun the use of dummy copy but then designers might want to ask them to provide style sheets with the copy decks they supply that are in tune with the design direction they require.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Summing up, if the copy is diverting attention from the design it&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s not up to task.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Typographers of yore didn&#39;t come up with the concept of dummy copy because people thought that content is inconsequential window dressing, only there to be used by designers who can&rsquo;t be bothered to read. Lorem Ipsum is needed because words matter, a lot. Just fill up a page with draft copy about the client&rsquo;s business and they will actually read it and comment on it.

(46, 'Creating an Image Zoom Library With Vanilla JavaScript', '<p>In this tutorial we are going to build a simple JavaScript library for adding zoom-on-hover effects to images. We will make the whole library from scratch, without relying on jQuery or any other external dependencies. Let&#39;s jump right in!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Project</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see this type of effect on many shopping sites, including very popular ones like <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/\" target=\"_blank\">eBay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>. It usually consists of a group of small photos which can be enlarged and inspected in further detail with an on-hover magnifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<figure><video loop=\"\" autoplay=\"\" controls=\"\" src=\"https://tutorialzine.com/media/2017/08/vanilla-zoom-demo.mp4\"></video><figcaption>Our Library in Action</figcaption></figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep the tutorial simple we won&#39;t be adding too many features to the library. It will contain only one JavaScript file, plus an optional CSS file for quickly styling a gallery like the one above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Designing the Library</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we start building the library, let&#39;s take a look at how we want people to use it. Making that design decision first will make developing the actual library easier later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since we are making a gallery plugin, people who use it will need to have some boilerplate HTML. This markup will contain their images, an empty <code>div</code> for the zoom effect, as well as some predefined classes to make the library work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>People are free to change this layout and add as many images as they want. It&#39;s important, however, that every image has the <code>.small-preview</code> class, and that there is an empty div with the <code>.zoomed-image</code> class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The library will be mainly JavaScript driven but there are also a few important CSS styles that need to be set. Users can include our CSS file directly in their HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that the markup and styles are set, all that is left is to include the library and initialize it.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Including the library&#39;s .js file makes the <code>vanillaZoom</code> object globally available. The object has only one method which is for initializing the plugin. It takes a single parameter - the id of our gallery. This way we can have multiple independent galleries initialized on one page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Developing the Library</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When building front-end JavaScript libraries we need to make sure we register their API properly. There are many ways to do this, possibly the easiest of which is <a href=\"http://checkman.io/blog/creating-a-javascript-library/\" target=\"_blank\">this method</a> by Jordan Checkman. We advise you to read his full blog post, but in short it boils down to this:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n<code>\r\n(function(window) {\r\n  function define_library() {\r\n    // Create the library object and all its properties and methods.\r\n    var vanillaZoom = {};\r\n    vanillaZoom.init = function(galleryId) {\r\n      // Our library&#39;s logic goes here.\r\n    }\r\n    return vanillaZoom;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Add the vanillaZoom object to global scope if its not already defined.\r\n  if(typeof(vanillaZoom) === &#39;undefined&#39;) {\r\n    window.vanillaZoom = define_library();\r\n  }\r\n  else{\r\n    console.log(&quot;Library already defined.&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n})(window);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The above code is wrapped in a self executing function. This way when we add the <code>vanilla-zoom.js</code> file to our project, the library will be automatically registered and the <code>vanillaZoom</code> object with all its methods will be made available to the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our library has only one method - <code>vanillaZoom.init(galleryId)</code>. Its job is to select the gallery DOM elements and add event listeners to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First we check if the proper elements have been added to the HTML and select them. We can&#39;t use jQuery so we have to rely on the native JavaScript methods for working with the DOM.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nvar container = document.querySelector(el);\r\n\r\nif(!container) {\r\n    console.error(&#39;Please specify the correct class of your gallery.&#39;);\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar firstSmallImage = container.querySelector(&#39;.small-preview&#39;);\r\nvar zoomedImage = container.querySelector(&#39;.zoomed-image&#39;);\r\n\r\nif(!zoomedImage) {\r\n    console.error(&#39;Please add a .zoomed-image element to your gallery.&#39;);\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif(!firstSmallImage) {\r\n    console.error(&#39;Please add images with the .small-preview class to your gallery.&#39;);\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    // Set the source of the zoomed image.\r\n    zoomedImage.style.backgroundImage = &#39;url(&#39;+ firstSmallImage.src +&#39;)&#39;;\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last line of the above code we take the image source of one of the preview images and set it as the background of our zoomable element. This happens as soon as <code>vanillaZoom.init(galleryId)</code> is called, making sure that our gallery doesn&#39;t stay empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do the same when one of the previews is clicked. This allows the user to select which image they want magnified.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ncontainer.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function (event) {\r\n  var elem = event.target;\r\n\r\n  if (elem.classList.contains(&quot;small-preview&quot;)) {\r\n      zoomedImage.style.backgroundImage = &#39;url(&#39;+ elem.src +&#39;)&#39;;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Selecting Images</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnifier element has a couple of event listeners attached to it. The first one is activated when the cursor enters the element, increasing the size of the background image, thus creating a zoom effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nzoomedImage.addEventListener(&#39;mouseenter&#39;, function(e) {\r\n    this.style.backgroundSize = &quot;250%&quot;; \r\n}, false);</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the image is now very large, it won&#39;t fit in the container and only part of it will be visible. We want users to be able to select which portion of the image is magnified so we add a mousemove listener that changes the background position.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nzoomedImage.addEventListener(&#39;mousemove&#39;, function(e) {\r\n\r\n  // getBoundingClientReact gives us various information about the position of the element.\r\n  var dimentions = this.getBoundingClientRect();\r\n\r\n  // Calculate the position of the cursor inside the element (in pixels).\r\n  var x = e.clientX - dimentions.left;\r\n  var y = e.clientY - dimentions.top;\r\n\r\n  // Calculate the position of the cursor as a percentage of the total size of the element.\r\n  var xpercent = Math.round(100 / (dimentions.width / x));\r\n  var ypercent = Math.round(100 / (dimentions.height / y));\r\n\r\n  // Update the background position of the image.\r\n  this.style.backgroundPosition = xpercent+&#39;% &#39; + ypercent+&#39;%&#39;;\r\n\r\n}, false);</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnifying Specific Part of Image</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the cursor leaves the magnified image we want it to go back to normal. This is easily done by returning the background size to <code>cover</code> and the background position to <code>center</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nzoomedImage.addEventListener(&#39;mouseleave&#39;, function(e) {\r\n    this.style.backgroundSize = &quot;cover&quot;; \r\n    this.style.backgroundPosition = &quot;center&quot;; \r\n}, false);</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>And with that, we are done!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Browser Support</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The library should work in all modern desktop browsers, although some of the flexbox CSS may not be displayed properly on older IE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, the zoom effect doesn&#39;t translate very well to touch devises. Because of this and the limited screen space, it&#39;s best to present your images in another way for mobile. In our CSS we&#39;ve simply hidden the zoom element and listed the images vertically but you can try other solutions such as a carousel.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can get the full source code for this article, as well as the demo code (with images courtesy to <a href=\"https://burst.shopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Burst</a>), from the <strong>Download</strong> button near the top of the page.

You just paste it in our dashboard and get an API.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are we doing today?</h3>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Get your Instagram Long-lived token</li>\r\n	<li>Fill a two-step form</li>\r\n	<li>Voila, you have an Instagram feed API ready.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get the token</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.
